# Grabb Grab Grub
An aim-and-shoot game developed solo in about two weeks over winter break 2021. Play the game in your browser on [itch.io](https://raddishradish.itch.io/grabb-grab-grub)!

Since I had only worked on games in teams before and primarily on art, I challenged myself to solo making a game so I could familiarize myself with game development more holistically. I prototyped and implemented game mechanics and a text parser in C#, illustrated in Adobe Photoshop, and composed [main menu](https://musescore.com/user/39562343/scores/7325780/s/kd3eSL) and [background](https://musescore.com/user/39562343/scores/7325804/s/s3T9Qs) music in MuseScore.

## Status
Project last updated December 26, 2021 (excluding README updates)

The published version is complete!

I most likely won't come back to this project, but things I wish I had have done for QoL include
* Varying difficulty
* Adding audio options
* Thinking about UI anchoring
* Including a pause menu
* Implementing an endless mode
* Display number of bugs caught or time left on game over or win screen respectively
* Letting the tongue overlap the buttons on the main menu
