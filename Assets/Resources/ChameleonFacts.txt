There are over 170 species of chameleon, all of which are part of the iguana suborder.
The largest chameleon by weight is the Parsonâ€™s chameleon, and the largest chameleon by length is the Malagasy giant chameleon.
The nano-chameleon, discovered in 2021, is the smallest chameleon and the smallest reptile at 22-29 mm long.
Chameleons change color mainly for temperature regulation and communication with other chameleons.
A layer of cells called iridophores, or guanophores, is the key to the chameleon's ability to change color.
Chameleons are found in Africa, Asia, and Europe in rainforests, lowlands, deserts, semi-deserts, scrub savannas, and mountains.
The smaller the chameleon, the faster the tongue. They can take advantage of their muscle tissue's elastic recoil.
Unlike many other lizards, chameleons are not able to regenerate their tails.
Chameleon eyes can move independently of each other, enabling them to look in two different directions at once.
Chameleons are solitary animals that only contact others of their kind when mating.
All chameleons are primarily insectivores. Larger chameleons also eat small birds and other lizards.
Smaller chameleons have proportionally longer tongues than larger ones and can project their tongues more than twice their body length.
Some chameleons in Madagascar have bones that glow under ultraviolet light, a phenomenon known as biogenic fluorescence.
Most chameleons lay eggs, but some species, like the Jackson's chameleon, have live births.
Small chameleon species lay two to four eggs while larger chameleons lay 80 to 100 eggs at one time.
Labord's chameleon lives for only about 4 to 5 months, which is the shortest recorded lifespan of a four-legged vertebrate.
A chameleon's tongue is anchored to the back of its mouth by a U-shaped bone called the hyoid with muscle wrapped around it.
The English word "chameleon" comes from the Latin "chamaeleon," which comes from Greek for "lion on the ground."
